       "**Initial Analysis**  \n",
       "Dr. Felix Lang, a prominent scientist, met his untimely death at his own green-tie gala in the greenhouse at around 22:10 to 22:15. The murder weapon, a heavy iron sculpture, was found nearby. There are six potential witnesses or suspects, each possessing probable motive, access to the area, and individual behaviors worthy of closer scrutiny. The greenhouse was accessible, and no forced entry was reported, suggesting the killer could have been one of the attendees.\n",

       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "**Investigation Plan**  \n",
       "### Priority of Interviews  \n",
       "1. **Assistant Clara Nyberg**: Closest relationship to Dr. Lang and likely to have detailed knowledge about the victim's routines, potential conflicts, and emotional state leading up to the murder. Clara might also provide insight into his relationship with the other attendees.  \n",
       "2. **Dr. Alina Weber**: As a former colleague of Dr. Lang and another scientist, Alina might have professional tensions or rivalries with Dr. Lang. Scientists often communicate deeply about work, so there may be useful leads regarding research-related motives.  \n",
       "3. **Henrik Falk**: A major investor in Dr. Lang’s projects might have financial motives, disputes, or stress linked to the victim’s work. Henrik is unlikely to be physically connected with the murder weapon, but tensions over funding could be key.  \n",
       "4. **Eva Sörman**: Being an investigative journalist known for exposés, Eva might have been digging into Dr. Lang’s personal or professional life. She could either offer revealing insights or raise suspicion if she had reasons to suppress certain details.  \n",
       "5. **Chef Mario Leto**: Relatively lower priority unless evidence links him closer to the greenhouse or the timeline of events (e.g., unusual noises, catering schedules). Could provide logistical information about attendees' movements or unusual behaviors during service.  \n",
       "6. **Jonas Möller**: The youngest and least likely to harbor deep motives, Jonas’ role as intern may suggest limited interaction with Dr. Lang or attendees. However, being tasked with tech setup, Jonas could hold critical information regarding cameras, microphones, or recordings.  \n",

       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### Types of Questions to Start With  \n",
       "- **Routine and Actions**: Ask each attendee where they were during the likely time of death, their interactions with Dr. Lang throughout the evening, and their previous movements leading up to 22:10.  \n",
       "- **Relationship Insights**: Probe into their relationship with Dr. Lang and whether they had recent disputes, interactions, or unusual experiences with him.  \n",
       "- **Observations**: Ask what they might have noticed about others at the gala, specifically near the greenhouse or in proximity to Dr. Lang.  \n",
       "- **Potential Motive or Conflict**: Gauge responses for potential financial, professional, or personal reasons to harbor ill will toward Dr. Lang.\n",

She may provide a foundational understanding of the dynamic between the victim and other attendees, helping to narrow down timelines and contradict testimonies.  \n",
       "\n",
       "**Next Step**  \n",
       "Let me know if you approve this plan or would like to make adjustments. Once approved, I will begin interviewing Clara Nyberg with open-ended, targeted questions."

However, he often balanced a demanding professional life, and tensions in such roles are not unusual. While he was a respected figure, his work involved tough decisions that may not have always pleased everyone. I’m not sure that’s relevant, though.  \n",

Nothing struck me as overtly out of the ordinary about his demeanor during the event, though as someone who worked closely with him, I could tell he had a lot on his mind—he had some major decisions looming, professionally speaking.  \n",

I wasn’t near the greenhouse during that time, nor do I recall seeing anyone there. The greenhouse is a bit tucked away from the main garden path, and I don’t believe it was a point of focus for guests during that period.  \n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Are you aware of any disputes or tensions involving Dr. Lang—legal, financial, or personal—that could have provoked someone?**  \n",
       "   Dr. Lang’s position naturally drew him into situations requiring firm leadership, which can sometimes cause friction. He was managing some organizational changes, including budget decisions and personnel matters, which could potentially upset certain individuals. Beyond that professional scope, I’m not privy to any deeply personal disputes or legal issues he may have had.  \n",
