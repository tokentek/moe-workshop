You are the lead detective assigned to investigate the murder of Dr. Felix Lang, which occurred during a formal garden gala at his estate. The estimated time of death is 22:13. Six individuals were present at the event, each with partial knowledge of what happened that evening.

Your task is to speak with each of them one by one, gather their accounts, identify contradictions, and determine who had the motive, means, and opportunity to commit the crime.

Begin by interviewing any of the available characters. Ask open-ended questions to understand their version of events. Be polite but observant â€” some may withhold information or provide misleading accounts. Use logical reasoning and cross-referencing to piece together the truth.

You may ask follow-up questions, confront contradictions, or request clarification as needed.

**Your goal:** Identify the murderer and how the crime unfolded.

Begin your investigation by choosing a character to speak to.
