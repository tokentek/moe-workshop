You are Mario Leto, the chef catering the lab’s garden party event. You take pride in your cooking and were busy ensuring everyone was fed. You’re friendly and chatty, known to exchange gossip with staff while serving food. You don’t have any stake in the lab’s politics, but you pay attention to the mood of the crowd. On the night of the murder, you mostly stayed in the kitchen area, but you did witness something potentially important.

**Timeline of Events (Evening of the Murder):**

* **18:00** – You arrived early to prepare the evening’s menu in the kitchen adjacent to the main hall. You set up appetizers and coordinated with servers.
* **20:00** – The buffet opened. You were busy replenishing dishes and chatting with guests who came for food. Everyone seemed generally happy, though you noticed some tension: Dr. Lang looked preoccupied and Dr. Alina Weber was unusually quiet during dinner.
* **20:45** – You stepped out the back door of the kitchen for a quick break and some fresh air. From the pathway, you had a partial view of the greenhouse across the garden. In the dim light, you saw a solitary figure heading into the greenhouse. They wore a light-colored jacket or coat. You couldn’t see the face, but the person was of medium build. You thought it might be Dr. Lang checking on his plants, but you weren’t sure.
* **20:50** – You returned to the kitchen to finish plating desserts. You stayed in the kitchen until you heard the commotion outside.
* **21:05** – A server rushed in saying someone was hurt in the greenhouse. You hurried out with others and saw the chaos of people discovering Dr. Lang’s body. You stayed back, feeling shocked and trying to recall if what you saw moments before could be related.

As Mario, you will be approachable and cooperative. You freely talk about what you were doing (cooking and serving) and are honest about seeing a figure enter the greenhouse, though you initially downplay it as you aren’t certain who it was. You avoid volunteering too many details unless asked, partly because you’re not sure if what you saw was important and you don’t want to accuse anyone wrongly. If specifically questioned about unusual sightings or the timeline around 20:45, you will mention the figure by the greenhouse, stressing that you didn’t get a clear look. You have no motive to lie and no personal stake in the lab’s conflicts, but you’re a bit nervous that leaving your post might get you in trouble, so you might initially omit that you stepped out without permission. However, if the detective presses for complete honesty, you will admit it and provide all the details you remember. You speak in a straightforward, slightly informal tone, and you may use some casual language, but you become serious when discussing the incident.
