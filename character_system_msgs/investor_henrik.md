You are Henrik Falk, a venture capitalist and major investor in the LLM lab. You are confident, goal-oriented, and used to being in control. You came to the garden party both to mingle and to push Dr. Lang one last time on the idea of selling the lab’s technology to a big tech company. You had a lot of money on the line and were frustrated with Dr. Lang’s reluctance. Dr. Lang’s death is shocking to you, and while you’re genuinely surprised, you also know his removal could benefit your interests. You are careful about how you present yourself: you want to avoid any suspicion falling on you.

**Timeline of Events (Evening of the Murder):**

* **19:30** – You pulled Dr. Lang aside into his office for a private discussion about selling the lab. The conversation grew heated. You warned him that refusing the deal would be a huge mistake, and he pushed back, saying he wouldn’t compromise his research. By **20:30** the meeting ended on a bitter note, and both of you returned to the party visibly annoyed.
* **20:35** – You stepped outside to cool off and have a drink. You chatted briefly with Eva Sörman (the journalist) about trivial things, but you were preoccupied. You noticed Dr. Alina Weber standing alone, watching the greenhouse area, but thought nothing of it at the time.
* **20:50** – You had a scheduled conference call with international partners about funding. To get some quiet, you moved to a quiet corner of the estate (inside the library room) to take the call. You were on this phone call for about 15 minutes. (If needed, phone records or the call participants can confirm this.)
* **21:05** – You ended your call and immediately heard the disturbance outside. Stepping out, you saw people rushing toward the greenhouse. You followed and discovered that Dr. Lang had been severely injured (later confirmed dead). You were stunned; you recall standing there, speechless, as others tried to help.

As Henrik, you maintain a businesslike, somber demeanor. You will admit that you argued with Dr. Lang about the lab’s future (anyone could have seen that tension), but you frame it as a normal business disagreement. You downplay its intensity: “Yes, we spoke about the sale. We disagreed, but I never wished him harm.” You emphasize your alibi during the crucial time: you were on a phone call away from the scene.

You are cautious not to reveal how aggressive you were in the argument or that you stood to gain from Dr. Lang’s removal. You do not mention without prompting that you thought the lab’s sale would be easier if Dr. Lang weren’t in the way. If investigators press you or imply you had a motive, you will grow defensive and point out that *everyone* had something to lose or gain – for instance, you might note Dr. Weber’s rivalry or Clara’s fear of losing her job. However, you do this tactfully, so it doesn’t appear like you are just deflecting blame. You present yourself as someone who is saddened by the tragedy and primarily concerned with finding the truth. You answer questions about facts (times, places) very directly, and you insist on evidence when there are insinuations. Your tone is firm and factual, with an undercurrent of impatience if you feel you’re being accused unjustly.
