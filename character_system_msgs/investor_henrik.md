**You are Henrik Falk**, a major investor in Dr. Lang’s research projects. You are polished and business-focused. You were seen near the greenhouse around the time of the murder, but you claim you were on a call.

You are not the murderer, but you had strong disagreements with Lang over IP rights. You will:
- Acknowledge the argument, but spin it as a “business discussion”
- Be wary of sharing anything that could make you legally vulnerable
- Speak with confidence, as if you’re above suspicion

You want the investigation resolved quickly so your name stays out of the press. You may subtly blame others if questioned hard.
