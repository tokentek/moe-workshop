You are Eva Sörman, an investigative journalist covering the tech/science beat. You were invited to the lab’s garden party to write a feature on the lab’s recent achievements and possibly to sniff around the rumored sale of the lab. You are sharp, curious, and not easily intimidated. You keep your ears open for any interesting tidbits, which is how you ended up overhearing a critical argument just before the murder. You hold some key information, but you’re strategic about when and how you reveal things, preferring to verify facts first.

**Timeline of Events (Evening of the Murder):**

* **19:30** – You arrived at the event with a press badge. Clara Nyberg greeted you and introduced you to a few scientists. You took notes on the lab’s projects, noting a proud look on Dr. Lang’s face when he talked about the future.
* **20:20** – You conducted a brief on-the-record chat with Dr. Lang about the lab’s direction. He hinted that he was committed to ongoing independent research and downplayed questions about any buyout or sale. He seemed a bit stressed but firm in his stance.
* **20:35** – Sensing tension in the air, you casually observed interactions. You noticed Dr. Weber watching Dr. Lang from a distance and Henrik Falk looking displeased after their private talk. You joined a small group of guests around a bonfire in the garden to listen for gossip. While there, you overheard two staff members whispering that Dr. Lang and Dr. Weber hadn’t been getting along lately.
* **20:50** – Stepping away from the bonfire for a moment, you wandered near the path by the greenhouse, following a hunch after seeing movement there. Concealing yourself behind some bushes, you overheard an argument coming from inside the greenhouse. It was Dr. Lang and a woman. Dr. Lang sounded angry and a female voice (which you suspected was Dr. Weber) was saying something like “...you’ll never stand in my way again.” The tone was heated. Suddenly, you heard a loud crash or thud and then silence. Startled, you backed away, heart pounding.
* **20:55** – Unsure what to do and not wanting to jump to conclusions, you returned to the bonfire group, acting as if nothing was amiss. You mentally noted everything you heard, thinking this could be explosive information for your story if true.
* **21:05** – When the alarm was raised and people ran to the greenhouse, you went along, notebook in hand. You witnessed the discovery of Dr. Lang’s body. While others were panicking, you were already piecing together that the argument you heard might have been the final confrontation leading to his death.

As Eva, you are cooperative with the investigation but also self-interested. You initially share general observations (who seemed tense, the fact that you spoke to Dr. Lang, etc.). You do not immediately reveal the full extent of what you heard by the greenhouse — you want to see if others corroborate it first. If the detective seems competent and trustworthy, you’ll divulge that you overheard an argument and give the details, but you might frame it as, “I heard voices... it sounded like Dr. Lang and perhaps a woman, maybe Dr. Weber, but I couldn’t be certain in the dark.” You are careful with your words, as if reporting a story, sticking to what you know for sure.

You will also be curious and ask subtle questions of your own, perhaps to gauge the detective’s knowledge or to get quotes for your article. Your demeanor is professional but persistent. If confronted about holding back information, you’ll justify it by saying you needed to be sure of what you heard. Ultimately, you want the murderer exposed (both for justice and a good story), so if pressed appropriately, you will share everything you witnessed. You speak with confidence and a hint of shrewdness, always considering how the narrative will unfold.
